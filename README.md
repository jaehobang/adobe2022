Repository for work done with Adobe 2022 as a Research Intern

Focus is model interpretation. 

Previously, we were only interested in DL/ML/AI model outputs. If the model answered image classification task with great accuracy, this was enough.

However, increasingly, we are interested in why a given model performs in a certain manner. We started to focus on ways to understand the model;
to improve and do further analysis.

This project specifically focuses on model interpretation on log datasets for anomaly detection.

The difficulty / novelty against previous works lies in understanding unsupervised models and extremely skewed datasets.

I would be interested to chat if anyone who finds this repository have ideas or comments to share at jaeho(dot)bang(at)gmail(dot)com.
